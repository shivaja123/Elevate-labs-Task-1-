I took a netflix movies and tv shows dataset from kaggle. 
For data preprocessing i used python(anaconda navigator).
firstly i loaded the dataset then checked wether there is any duplicates or not
Then checked the null values and droped all null values.
checking the missing 'rating' movies title and search their 'rating' on internet
Replace the missing 'rating' values which are found from IMDb and netflix the i added new features and new column 'target age' and 'rating'.
